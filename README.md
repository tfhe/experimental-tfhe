proof of concepts and experimental code for TFHE

This repository is meant to show proof of concepts and experimental features that could be added to future releases of TFHE.

Each folder corresponds to a different proof of concept, tutorial, or sample application, possibly by different authors. Therefore, each folder may have its own (open-source) licence and/or copyright.
